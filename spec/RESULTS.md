# Test Results for @quiltdata/benchling-webhook@0.4.13

## Package Status

✅ Package successfully published to npm
- Package: `@quiltdata/benchling-webhook`
- Version: `0.4.13`
- Published: Yes
- URL: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@quiltdata/benchling-webhook

## Import Test Results

❌ **Import Test Failed**

### Issue

The package was published with TypeScript source files (`.ts`) but Node.js cannot import them directly:

```
Error: Stripping types is currently unsupported for files under node_modules,
for "/Users/ernest/GitHub/benchling-webhook/.scratch/node_modules/@quiltdata/benchling-webhook/lib/index.ts"
```

### Root Cause

The `package.json` has:
```json
{
  "main": "lib/index.ts"
}
```

But npm packages should point to compiled JavaScript files (`.js`), not TypeScript source (`.ts`).

### Solution Required

Before the next publish, the package needs to be configured to either:

1. **Compile TypeScript to JavaScript** (recommended):
   - Add a build step: `tsc` to compile `.ts` → `.js`
   - Change `main` to point to `lib/index.js`
   - Publish the compiled `.js` files
   - Add `types` field pointing to `.d.ts` files

2. **Or publish as TypeScript package** (less common):
   - Configure package for TypeScript-only consumption
   - Consumers would need TypeScript setup

## Recommendation

The package is published but **not yet usable** by consumers. A new version needs to be published with compiled JavaScript files.

Would you like me to:
1. Add a build configuration to compile TypeScript before publishing?
2. Update the package.json to support proper npm distribution?
