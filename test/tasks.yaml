    Endpoints that perform expensive computations launch long-running tasks. These
    endpoints return the task ID (a UUID) in the response body.


    After launching a task, periodically invoke the [Get a task](#/Tasks/getTask)
    endpoint with the task UUID (e.g., every 10 seconds), until the status is no longer
    RUNNING.


    You can access a task for up to 30 minutes after its completion, after which its
    data will no longer be available.
